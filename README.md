# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

The game features a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking X and O in an attempt to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Graphical user interface built with Java AWT components
- Player turns and alternating X and O marks
- Real-time updates of game status displayed in a label
- Win detection to determine the winner or a draw
- Visual highlighting of winning moves
- Automatic disabling of buttons after the game ends


## Usage

- Run the application by executing the AWT_TicTacToe class.
- The game window will appear with an empty 3x3 grid and a label indicating the current player's turn.
- Click on the buttons to place your mark (X or O) on the grid.
- The game will automatically determine if there is a winner or a draw and display the result.
- To start a new game, simply close the current window and run the application again.


## Lessons Learnt

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development: The project helps in understanding the basics of GUI development using Java AWT. It covers concepts like creating windows, panels, labels, buttons, and handling user interactions.

- Event Handling: The project demonstrates how to handle user actions, such as button clicks, using event listeners and the ActionListener interface. It provides insights into event-driven programming and how to respond to user input effectively.

- Game Logic Implementation: The project involves implementing the game logic for Tic Tac Toe, including checking for winning conditions and detecting a draw. It provides insights into structuring and organizing game-related code.
